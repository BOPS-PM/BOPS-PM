## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub.  I'd like to be an active user in the GitHub Community.

Right now, I am testing to see if the static line appears after each row. 

I realized that it does not; however, I just learned that I must skip a row in order for content to appear on a separate line.  As well as there is no spell check...possibly ğŸ¤”
